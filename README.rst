hgapi is a pure-Python API to Mercurial, that uses the command-line
interface instead of the internal Mercurial API. The rationale for
this is twofold: the internal API is unstable, and it is GPL.

hgapi works for all versions of Mercurial, and will instantly reflect any
changes to the repository (including hgrc). It also has a really 
permissive license (do whatever you want, don't blame me).

For example of code that uses this API, take a look at
https://bitbucket.org/haard/autohook which now uses hgapi
exclusively. Add any feature requests or bugs found to the issue tracker.

So far, the API supports::

 hg init
 hg id
 hg add <file>
 hg commit [files] [-u name] [--close-branch]
 hg update <rev>
 hg heads
 hg log
 hg remove
 hg status
 hg merge (fails on conflict)
 hg revert
 hg branch
 hg branches
 hg tag
 hg tags
 hg diff
 hg version
 hg clone

You also have access to the configuration (config, configbool,
configlist) just as in the internal Mercurial API. The repository 
supports slicing and indexing notation.

Example usage::
    >>> import hgapi
    >>> repo = hgapi.Repo("test_hgapi")  # existing folder
    >>> repo.hg_init()
    >>> repo.hg_add("file.txt")  # already created but not added file
    >>> repo.hg_commit("Adding file.txt", user="me")
    >>> str(repo['tip'].desc)
    'Adding file.txt'
    >>> len(repo[0:'tip'])
    1
    >>> open('test_hgapi/file.txt', 'a').write('\nAdded line') # doctest: +IGNORE_RESULT
    >>> diff = repo.hg_diff()  # returns list of diffs
    >>> assert diff[0]['filename'] == 'file.txt'
    >>> assert '+Added line' in diff[0]['diff']
    
Installation
============

Easiest is easy_install or pip from PyPy::
